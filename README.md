During the execution of the project, I imported the dataset, created a database, and wrote queries in Microsoft SQL Server. I connected Microsoft Power BI to Microsoft SQL Server and undertook the tasks of data importing, data cleaning, data transformation, and dashboard building in Microsoft Power BI. I evaluated the busiest times, sales performance, best sellers, and worst sellers to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction in the pizza business.
